I am a first year PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) (AMLab) supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/), [Ana Miƒákoviƒá](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/m/i/a.mickovic/a.mickovic.html) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). I strongly believe that causality can make machine learning more robust and more explainable. My research interests intersect causal inference, reinforcement learning, domain adaptation, time series modelling and graph structured data modelling. I am working on the "Robust fraud detection through causality-inspired ML" project as part of the AI4FinTech initiative. 

Feel free to contact me for possible collaborations!
