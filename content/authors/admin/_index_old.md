I am a PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) (AMLab) supervised by [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/), [Ana Miƒákoviƒá](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/m/i/a.mickovic/a.mickovic.html) and [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). I am mainly interested in methods that can discover and utilize causal information.
